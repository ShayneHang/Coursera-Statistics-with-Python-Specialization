Moreover, these effects are additive, meaning that if we compare, say, a 50 year old man to a 40 year old woman, the man's blood pressure will on average be around 3.23 + 10*0.47 = 7.93 units higher, with the first term in this sum being attributable to gender, and the second term being attributable to age.\n",

Given two subjects with the same gender and age, and whose BMI differs by 1 unit, the person with greater BMI will have, on average, 0.31 units greater systolic blood pressure (SBP).  After adding BMI to the model, the coefficient for gender became somewhat greater (from 3.23 to 3.57). This is due to the fact that the three covariates in the model, age, gender, and BMI, are mutually correlated, as seen from correlation matrix above.\n",

    "This fitted model suggests that older people are more likely to have a history of smoking than younger people.  The log odds for smoking increases by 0.017 for each year of age.  This effect is additive, so that comparing two people whose ages differ by 20 years, the log odds of the older person smoking will be around 0.34 units (0.0172*20) greater than the log odds for the younger person smoking, and the odds for the older person smoking will be around `exp(0.34) = 1.4` (e^0.34) times greater than the odds for the younger person smoking.\n",
    "\n",
    "The greater prevalence of smoking history among older people could be partly due to the definition of smoking status that we are using here -- an older person has had more time to smoke 99 cigarettes than a younger person.  However most people who smoke begin when they are young, and the smoking rate in the US has been slowly declining for several decades.  Thus, it is likely that the increased smoking levels in older people are driven primarily by real shifts in behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "As with linear regression, the roles of age and gender in the logistic regression model can be seen as being additive, but here the additivity is on the scale of log odds, not odds or probabilities.  If we compare a 30 year old female to a 50 year old male, the log odds for the male being a smoker are `0.89 + 0.34 = 1.23` units greater than the log odds for the female being a smoker.  The value of 0.89 in this expression is the change attributable to gender, and the value of 0.34 is the change attributable to age (0.34 = 20* 0.0172).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Again, we can exponentiate to convert these effects from the log odds scale to the odds scale.  Since `exp(0.89 + 0.34) = exp(0.89)*exp(0.34) = 2.44*1.41` we can state that male gender is associated with a 2.44 fold increase in the odds of smoking, and 20 years of age is associated with a 1.41 fold increase in the odds for smoking.  These two effects are multiplied when discussing the odds, so a 50 year old man has `exp(1.23) = 3.42` (same as 2.44* 1.41) fold greater odds of smoking than a 30 year old woman.\n",
